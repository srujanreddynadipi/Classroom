Applies when an element is clicked or tabbed into, regardless of mouse button state.
Useful for highlighting input fields, buttons, or links to indicate where the user is interacting.

   :active

Represents the element that is currently being activated by the user.
Applies only during the brief period between when a mouse button is pressed down on an element and when it is released.
Often used to provide visual feedback for button clicks or link activation (like a button getting slightly pressed). -->
